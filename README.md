# Applivery Community Scripts 🚀

Welcome to the official repository for **Applivery Community Scripts**. This project is a curated collection of automation scripts designed to help IT Administrators manage, configure, and secure their fleet of devices using the Applivery MDM platform.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by Operating System. Each script has its own folder containing the script file and a specific documentation file.

* **/macOS**: Shell scripts (`.sh`) for macOS management (Intel and Apple Silicon).
* **/Windows**: PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`) for Windows 10/11 devices.

2.  **Open** the script folder and read the specific `README.md` for instructions and variables.
3.  **Copy** the code.
4.  **Login** to your [Applivery Dashboard](https://dashboard.applivery.com).
